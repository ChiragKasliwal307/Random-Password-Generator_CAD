# Random-Password-Generator_CAD


Project Plan & Proposal :-

Milestones :- Design UI, Implement functionality, Test and Debug, Deploy, Maintain and Support.

Scope :- To create an application that helps to generate highly secured password.

Objectives :- To provide a simple and user-friendly interface for users to interact.

Target Users :- Anyone who needs to generate/create strong password.

Technologies :- Python, Flask, HTML/CSS, multi-factor authentication libraries.




Architectural Style :- The client-side would consist of a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows the user to input any specific requirements for the 
                       password, such as the length, character set, and any specific rules for the password generation. The GUI may also have additional 
                       features such as password strength meters and copy-to-clipboard functionality.

                       The server-side would consist of the password generation algorithm, which would take the user's input and generate a random password 
                       that meets the specified requirements. The server may also include additional security features, such as hashing the password before 
                       sending it back to the client.

                       Overall, the architecture of a random password generator is relatively straightforward, with the primary focus being on the  
                       algorithm for generating strong, secure passwords.
